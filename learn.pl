#The $[ Special Variable - We have a special variable, which is written as $[. This special variable is a scalar containing the first index of all arrays. Because Perl arrays have zero-based indexing, 
#$[ will almost always be 0. But if you set $[ to 1 then all your arrays will use one-based indexing. It is recommended not to use any other indexing other than zero. However, let's take one example to show the usage of $[ variable âˆ’
